Binary with 0 and 1 is good, but binary with only 0, or almost, is even better! Originally, this is a concept designed 
by Chuck Norris to send so called unary messages.
Write a program that takes an incoming message as input and displays as output the message encoded using Chuck Norris’ method.


Here is the encoding principle:

    The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit)
    The encoded output message consists of blocks of 0
    A block is separated from another block by a space
    Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of same value bits (only 1 or 0 values):
    - First block: it is always 0 or 00. If it is 0, then the series contains 1, if not, it contains 0
    - Second block: the number of 0 in this block is the number of bits in the series

Let’s take a simple example with a message which consists of only one character: Capital C. C in binary is represented as 1000011, so with Chuck Norris’ technique this gives:

    0 0 (the first series consists of only a single 1)
    00 0000 (the second series consists of four 0)
    0 00 (the third consists of two 1)

So C is coded as: 0 0 00 0000 0 00
